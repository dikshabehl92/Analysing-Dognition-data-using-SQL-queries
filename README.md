# Analysing-Dognition-data-using-SQL-queries

DB Platform: MySQL
Frontend Tool : Jupyter 

I completed this analysis as part of the 'Managing Big Data using MySQL' course offered by Duke University on Coursera.

Objective:
- Dognition is looking for ways to increase the completion rate of their tests.
- Business changes that can increase the number of tests users complete on Dognition website.


The analysis focuses on understanding the following-
1. How does the Testing circumstances impact the test completion rate.

  a. Time of doing a test
  b. Geographic location of the test

2. How does the dog characteristics impact the test completion rate.

  a. Dognition personality dimension of the dog 
  b. Breed Group of the dog
  c. Neutered and not neutered dog
 
 Business Changes Proposed:
 1. Target marketing on certain types of Dognition tests to dog owners with dogs in the Herding and Sporting breed_groups might lead to an increase in the number of tests completed by users.
 2. Since most users complete the tests on Sunday and Friday has the least completion rate, it is a good idea to target reminder or encouragement messages to customers on Sundays.
 3. Since Dognition is most likely to be used by English-speaking countries. They might want to consider transalation of website in different languages to increase participation from non-English speaking countries.
