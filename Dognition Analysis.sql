NOTES AND HINTS: You cannot use a clause that says d.exclude does not equal 1 to remove rows that have exclude flags, because Dognition clarified that both NULL values and 0 values in the "exclude" column are valid data. A clause that says you should only include values that are not equal to 1 would remove the rows that have NULL values in the exclude column, because NULL values are never included in equals statements (as we learned in the join lessons). In addition, although it should not matter for this query, practice including parentheses with your OR and AND statements that accurately reflect the logic you intend. Your results should return 402 DogIDs in the ace dimension and 626 dogs in the charmer dimension.*/

/*Question 14: Which 5 states within the United States have the most Dognition customers, once all dog_guids and user_guids with a value of "1" in their exclude columns are removed? Try using the following general strategy: count how many unique user_guids are associated with dogs in the complete_tests table, break up the counts according to state, sort the results by counts of unique user_guids in descending order, and then limit your output to 5 rows. California ("CA") and New York ("NY") should be at the top of your list.*/

/*Observation:
The number of Dognition users in California is very high as compared to any other state.
Useful follow-up questions would be: were special promotions run in California that weren't run in other states? Did Dognition use advertising channels that are particularly effective in California? If not, what traits differentiate California users from other users? Can these traits be taken advantage of in future marketing efforts or product developments?*/

/*Observation:
The United States, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain are the countries with the most Dognition users.  After Great Britain, the number of Dognition users drops quite a lot. This analysis suggests that Dognition is most likely to be used by English-speaking countries. One question Dognition might want to consider is whether there are any countries whose participation would dramatically increase if a translated website were available.
